# Agenda Latina website
The idea is to create a cultural agenda website for the latin american community in Belgium using [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

## Inspiration
The goal is to create a sense of community for the latin american immigrants living in Belgium by concentrating socio cultural activities relevant to us in one page.

## Objective
We'll try to replicate the functionalities of [agenda.brussels](https://agenda.brussels/en/) and add some of our own. For this site to work, we'll need a large number of registered collaborators who will be adding events through a backoffice into the database. This events will be shown in the different categories where you will have a search field and a few sort filters to refine your search.

## Current status
The site is currently under development and is not still deployed.
